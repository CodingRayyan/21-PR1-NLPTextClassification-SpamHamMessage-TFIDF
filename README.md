# NLP Text Classification (TF-IDF) - Spam Message Detection,  98% Accuracy

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **NLP-based text classification** using **TF-IDF** for spam message detection. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify messages as **Spam** or **Ham** (Not Spam) using feature extraction techniques.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled text messages, categorized into **spam** and **ham** (legitimate messages). The dataset is preprocessed and transformed into numerical representations for training.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF** for feature extraction
- **Text preprocessing** (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
- **Machine learning models** for classification

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Load Spam Dataset**: Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Convert text to lowercase, remove special characters, tokenize, remove stopwords, and apply stemming/lemmatization.
3. **TF-IDF Feature Extraction**: Transform text data into numerical vectors.
4. **Pairplot Visualization**: Analyze feature distributions.
5. **Train-Test Split**: Split data for training and testing.
6. **Train a Classifier**: Fit a machine learning model to classify spam messages.
7. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📊 Results & Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using classification metrics like:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**
